360 controller wireless receiver raw USB gadget. (WIP)

Practically a copy of my other repo, but continuing this seperately to emulate the wireless receiver instead.
This in the hopes I can emulate multiple controllers over 1 usb connection with this.

Multiple controllers don't seem to work out of the box on MacOS. One could attempt installing proper drivers; [https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller)
